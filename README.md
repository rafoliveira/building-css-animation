# 3D Building Animation

This project implements a mall map animation concept of the building DETI. 
The idea was to implement a simple but efficient platform so the user can easily search for information in each room.
This is only the main page of a larger project made in the context of a university course.
All the information about that project can be found <a href="http://xcoa.av.it.pt/~pei2017-2018_g03/index.html">here</a>.
